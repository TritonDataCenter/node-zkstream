zkstream
========

A minimal streams-based node client for the ZooKeeper protocol.

API
---

## Client

### `new mod_zkstream.Client(options)`

Opens a new ZooKeeper connection and returns the Client instance.

Parameters:
 - `options`: an Object, with keys:
   - `address`: a String, hostname or IP to connect to
   - `port`: an optional Number (default: 2181)
   - `sessionTimeout`: an optional Number (default: 30000 ms)
   - `collector`: an optional Object, artedi collector

### `Client#close([cb])`

Closes the connection.

Parameters:
 - `cb`: an optional Function, called once the connection has ended

### Events

#### `session`

Emitted when the client establishes a new session with the ZK server. Will
generally be followed immediately by a `connect` event.

#### `connect`

Emitted when the client successfully connects to a ZooKeeper server, either
for the first time, or on subsequent reconnects after an error and failover
on to a different server.

#### `failed`

Emitted when the client has exhausted its retry policy and cannot connect
to any ZooKeeper servers.

#### `expire`

Emitted when the client's ZK session has expired. All ephemeral nodes created
by this client will have now disappeared from the view of other clients, and
any watchers will be invalid (will no longer emit events).

#### `close`

Emitted when the client has shut down at the request of a call to
`Client#close`.

### `Client#ping([cb])`

Manually pings the ZooKeeper server. Automatic pings occur every 2 seconds
without calling this function.

Parameters:
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err)`

### `Client#list(path[, cb])`

Lists the children at a given path.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to list children of
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err, children)` with parameters:
   - `children`: an Array of Strings

### `Client#isConnected()`

Determines whether the client has a working connection to ZooKeeper at the
present time.

Returns boolean.

### `Client#stat(path[, cb])`

Gathers basic information about the node at a given path, including its version
number (useful if you want to delete it).

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err, stat)` with parameters:
   - `stat`: an Object, with fields:
     - `version`: a Number, latest version
     - `dataLength`: a Number, size of data in bytes stored at node
     - `numChildren`: a Number, number of children
     - `ctime`: a `mod_jsbn.BigNumber`
     - `mtime`: a `mod_jsbn.BigNumber`
     - `ephemeralOwner`: a Buffer, ID of connection that owns this node
                         if it is ephemeral



### `Client#get(path[, cb])`

Gets the data stored in a given node.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err, data, stat)` with parameters:
   - `data`: a Buffer
   - `stat`: an Object, same format as `stat` in `Client#stat`


### `Client#getACL(path[, cb])`

Gets the data stored in a given node.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err, acl)` with parameters:
   - `acl`: an Array of Objects, ACL entries, with properties:
     - `id`: an Object, the principal the ACL entry applies to
       - `scheme`: a String, the principal URI scheme
       - `id`: a String, the remainder of the URI
     - `perms`: an Array of Strings, the permissions given to
       this principal


### `Client#delete(path, version[, cb])`

Deletes a given node as long as its latest version matches the given version.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `version`: a Number, latest version to check against
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err)`



### `Client#create(path, data[, options[, cb]])`

Creates a new node at the given path, containing some provided data.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node to be created
 - `data`: a Buffer
 - `options`: an optional Object, with keys:
   - `flags`: an optional Array of Strings, can be `'EPHEMERAL'` or
              `'SEQUENTIAL'`
   - `acl`: an optional Array of ACL objects
 - `cb`: a Function `(err, createdPath)`, the `createdPath` argument refers
   to the created node. It is important if the `SEQUENTIAL` flag was provided
   because it communicates to the client what name, and therefore sequence
   number, was selected for the final node.



### `Client#createWithEmptyParents(path, data[, options[, cb]])`

Creates a new node at the given path, creating any intermediate path
components and populating them with the data string `null`. If any
of the intermediate znodes already exist, neither their ACLs nor data
will be modified. Any intermediate component that doesn't exist will
be created with the ACLs given in the `options` object, if they
are provided. Any flags provided will be applied only to the final
node in the path. All intermediate nodes created by this function
are regular persistent zookeeper nodes.

Parameters:
 - `path`: a String, path to the node to be created
 - `data`: a Buffer
 - `options`: an optional Object, with keys:
   - `flags`: an optional Array of String, can be `'EPHEMERAL'` or
              `'SEQUENTIAL'`. These flags will only be applied to
              the node represented by the final path component, and
              not to any of the intermediate (parent) nodes. These
              intermediate nodes will be created with no flags.
   - `acl`: an optional Array of ACL objects
 - `cb`: a Function `(err, createdPath)`, the `createdPath` argument
   is passed through from the call to `Client#create` that creates
   the final node in the `path` specified as an argument to
   this function.



### `Client#set(path, data, version[, cb])`

Sets the contents of a given node as long as its latest version matches the
given version.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `data`: a Buffer, the new data to place in the node
 - `version`: a Number, version number as returned from `Client#stat`
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err)`



### `Client#sync(path[, cb])`

Forces the ZK leader to sync up with its followers on the state of the given
node.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node
 - `cb`: an optional Function `(err)`



### `Client#watcher(path)`

Returns a watcher EventEmitter for a given path.

Parameters
 - `path`: a String, path to the node to watch

## Watchers

### `Watcher#on('created', cb)`

Registers a callback to be called when a particular node is created. If the
node already exists right now, the callback will be called straight away.

Parameters
 - `cb`: a Function `(stat)` with arguments:
   - `stat`: an Object, same as the `stat` returned by `Client#stat` above

### `Watcher#on('deleted', cb)`

Registers a callback to be called when a particular node is deleted. If the
node does not exist right now, the callback will be called straight away.

NOTE: Deleted events may be missed during network outages.

Parameters
 - `cb`: a Function `()`

### `Watcher#on('dataChanged', cb)`

Registers a callback to be called when a particular node's data has changed. Always fires immediately with the current contents of the node if it exists.

Parameters
 - `cb`: a Function `(data)` with arguments:
   - `data`: a Buffer, contents of the node

### `Watcher#on('childrenChanged', cb)`

Registers a callback to be called when a particular node's children have
changed. Always fires immediately with the current children of the node if it
exists.

Parameters
 - `cb`: a Function `(children)` with arguments:
   - `children`: an Array of Strings

## ACL objects

Some methods return or take ACL objects as a parameter. These are plain
Objects, with keys:

 - `id`: an Object, with keys:
   - `scheme`: a String, the URI scheme of the target of the ACL entry
   - `id`: a String
 - `perms`: an Array of Strings, can be `'read'`, `'write'`, `'create'`,
            `'delete'`, `'admin'`
